\# Contract Management Platform



This project is a simple full-stack Contract Management Platform built as part of an assessment.  

It demonstrates how contracts can be created using predefined blueprints and then moved through a controlled lifecycle.



The focus of this project is \*\*workflow clarity, backend logic, and frontend–backend integration\*\*, not UI design.

\## What This Project Does



The platform allows users to:



\- Create \*\*Blueprints\*\* (templates for contracts)

\- Create \*\*Contracts\*\* based on those blueprints

\- Manage contracts through a fixed lifecycle:

&nbsp; - CREATED → APPROVED → SENT → SIGNED → LOCKED

\- View all contracts in a dashboard

\- Perform lifecycle actions using buttons



Lifecycle rules are enforced on the backend.
