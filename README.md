# Contract Management Platform

This project is a platform, for managing contracts. It is a stack **Contract Management Platform** that I built for a technical test.

This system shows us how we can make contracts using templates that are already set up. We can then move these contracts through stages. The rules, for this process are enforced by the system in the background so everything stays organized and follows the rules.

> **Note:** I thought about using Docker to make things better. I did not have the right setup for it. My application works on our computers and we use GitHub Pages to make the frontend available, to everyone.

I think Backend APIs are supposed to run on your computer. The Backend APIs are meant to be used.
